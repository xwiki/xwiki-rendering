# XWiki Core localization
#
# This contains the translations of the module in the default language
# (generally English).
# 
# See https://dev.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Community/L10N/Conventions/ for more details about about
# translation key naming.
#
# Comments: it's possible to add some detail about a key to make easier to
#   translate it by adding a comment before it. To make sure a comment is not
#   assigned to the following key use at least three sharps (###) for the comment
#   or after it.
# 
# Deprecated keys:
#   * when deleting a key it should be moved to deprecated section at the end
#     of the file (between #@deprecatedstart and #@deprecatedend) and associated to the
#     first version in which it started to be deprecated
#   * when renaming a key, it should be moved to the same deprecated section
#     and a comment should be added with the following syntax:
#     #@deprecated new.key.name
#     old.key.name=Some translation

rendering.macro.error.unknown=Unknown macro: {0}.
rendering.macro.error.unknown.description=The [{0}] macro is not in the list of registered macros. Verify the spelling or contact your administrator.
rendering.macro.error.failed=Failed to execute the [{0}] macro.
rendering.macro.error.invalid=Invalid macro: {0}.
rendering.macro.error.standalone=The [{0}] macro is a standalone macro and it cannot be used inline.
rendering.macro.error.standalone.description=This macro generates standalone content. As a consequence you need to make sure to use a syntax that separates your macro from the content before and after it so that it's on a line by itself. For example in XWiki Syntax 2.0+ this means having 2 newline characters (a.k.a line breaks) separating your macro from the content before and after it.
rendering.macro.error.invalidParameter=Invalid macro parameters used for the [{0}] macro.
